\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains a wrapper that facilitates the use of a Melexis MLX90640 thermal infrared camera for general use. 

The wrapper contains a class MLX\+\_\+\+Cam whose use is greatly simplified in comparison to that of the base class, {\ttfamily class} {\ttfamily MLX90640}, by mwerezak, who has a cool fox avatar, at {\ttfamily \href{https://github.com/mwerezak/micropython-mlx90640}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/mwerezak/micropython-\/mlx90640}}} 

To use this code, upload the directory {\ttfamily mlx90640} from mwerezak with all its contents to the root directory of your Micro\+Python device, then copy this file to the root directory of the Micro\+Python device.

There\textquotesingle{}s some test code at the bottom of this file which serves as a beginning example.
